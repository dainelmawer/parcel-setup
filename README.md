# Parcel React Setup with HMR and CSS Modules
I like Webpack, its super powerful, but its a headache to setup. I thought I'd give Parcel a go for this React setup. Once you bent your head around some of the more trivial concepts, it was painless to get going.

## Starting Development
To get started with development:

```
yarn start
```
This will spin up a development server at `http://localhost:1234` - Hot Module Replacement and CSS Modules ready.

## Production

To build assets for the server:

```
yarn build
```
